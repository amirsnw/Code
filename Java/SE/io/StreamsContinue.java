/**
 * Any class can implement the Serializable interface since there are no
 * required methods to implement.
 * 
 * Note that the requirement for properly marking an object as Serializable may
 * involve nested objects.
 * 
 * Therefore, any object references contained within the Tail class must belong
 * to classes that are also marked as Serializable , and so on.
 * 
 * Besides transient instance variables, static class members will also be
 * ignored during the serialization and deserialization process.
 * 
 * Why Not Mark Every Class as Serializable ?
 * 
 * The reason that we do not is that there are some classes that we want to
 * instruct the JVM not to serialize. In particular, process-heavy classes such
 * as the Thread class or any of the Stream classes would be difficult, often
 * impossible, to save to persistent storage, since much of their work involves
 * managing JVM processes or resources in real time.

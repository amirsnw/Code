The source code contains the following examples:

* Charset example.

* FileChannel example. This example reads from a classpath 
resource file src/main/resources/file/input.txt and writes 
a String literal to a classpath resource src/main/resources
/file/output.txt. Be sure to check the folder target/classes
/file when wanting to view the output of the write example.

* Client Server example. Start the server first, then start 
the client. The client will attempt 10 connections to the 
server and write the same text 10 times to the server which 
will simply write the contents to console.

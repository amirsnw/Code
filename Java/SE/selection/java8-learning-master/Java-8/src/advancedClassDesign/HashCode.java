 *         Whenever you override equals(), 
 *         you are also expected to override hashCode()
 *         
 *         1. Within the same program, the result of hashCode() must not change.
 *         this means that you sholdn't include variables that change in figuring 
 *         out the hash code.
 *         
 *         2. If equals() returns true when called with two objects, calling
 *         hashCode() on each of those objects must return the same result.
 *         This means hashCode() can use a subset of the variables that equals uses.
 *         
 *		   3. If equals returns false when called with two objects, calling hashCode() on each of 
 *		   those objects does not have to return a different result. This means hashCode() results 
 *		   do not need to be unique when called on unequal objects.
